The Python script provided in this repository is a text analyzer or a
Python filter. It gives you some basic stats and an advanced measure
called Type-Token Ratio (TTR).

TTR is a measure used to assess the diversity or richness of vocabulary in a text.
TTR = (Number of unique word types) / (Total number of words).

In order to use the script, put your find your text file and in a
terminal type the following:
#+begin_src
  python word_stats.py my_file.txt
#+end_src

Here is a sample output from the script:
#+begin_src
The text has  7077  characters,  1183  words, and  52  sentences.
The average lenght of a sentence is 22 word and standrd deviation of the length of sentence is 11.5  word
Type-Token Ratio (TTR): 0.49 
#+end_src
